POISE

================

Poise is the easiest way to get an accurate overall health reading using a web based platform. It calculates for each individual user a Health Score with a single point value. Poise aggregates health and fitness tracking data into one score, i.e. it uses an algorithm to calculate e.g. activities, body information and personal moods into one number.

Open the app, and you have access to the full functionality of this utility. Just submit your most recent and accurate health data into the model to obtain a "snapshot" of where your overall health currently stands. Then come back to submit new data to revise your three digit score. Continue adding your most recent and accurate health data to your profile. The more data used to calculate the score, the more valuable your score becomes. 

The goal is a playful call to a health-conscious behavior. Enjoy!
